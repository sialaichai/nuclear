            ],
            correctAnswer: 0,
            explanation: "Alpha particles consist of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, identical to a helium nucleus.",

            ],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "Gamma radiation has the greatest penetrating power as it's electromagnetic radiation, not particles.",

            ],
            correctAnswer: 2,
            explanation: "Carbon-14 is radioactive and used in carbon dating due to its known half-life of 5730 years.",
            hint: "Look for the isotope with a half-life suitable for archaeological dating.",

                "Energy is absorbed by the nucleus",
                "Electrons move to higher energy levels"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 0,
            explanation: "Radioactive decay occurs when an unstable nucleus emits radiation to become more stable.",
            hint: "Think about why atoms decay - they seek stability.",
