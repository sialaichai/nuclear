            question: "Explain why gamma radiation often accompanies alpha or beta decay:",
            options: [
                "Gamma rays carry away excess energy from the excited nucleus",
                "Gamma rays convert alpha to beta particles",
                "Gamma radiation causes the initial decay",
                "Gamma rays are produced when electrons change shells"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 0,
            explanation: "After alpha or beta decay, the daughter nucleus is often in an excited state. Gamma emission releases this excess energy.",
            hint: "What happens to the nucleus after it emits particles?",

            question: "In your own words, what does 'half-life' mean in radioactivity?",
            options: [
                "Time for half the radioactive atoms to decay",
                "Time for radiation intensity to reduce by half",
                "Time for all radioactive atoms to decay",
                "Time for radiation to travel half a meter"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 0,
            explanation: "Half-life is the time required for half of the radioactive atoms in a sample to undergo decay.",
            hint: "Think about what 'half' refers to in this context.",

            question: "Interpret this decay chain: Uranium-238 → Thorium-234 → Protactinium-234 → Uranium-234",
            options: [
                "Alpha decay followed by two beta decays",
                "Three alpha decays",
                "Three beta decays",
                "Gamma decay only"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 0,
            explanation: "U-238 decays by alpha to Th-234, which beta decays to Pa-234, which beta decays to U-234.",
            hint: "Look at how atomic and mass numbers change in each step.",

            question: "Why can't alpha particles penetrate skin but are dangerous if ingested?",
            options: [
                "They can't penetrate skin but cause intense ionization internally",
                "They change to gamma radiation inside the body",
                "Skin reflects them but organs absorb them",
                "They combine with beta particles internally"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 0,
            explanation: "Alpha particles have high ionization power but low penetration. Inside the body, they damage cells directly.",
            hint: "Consider ionization vs penetration properties.",

            question: "What is the main difference between fission and radioactive decay?",
            options: [
                "Fission splits nuclei; decay involves spontaneous emission",
                "Decay splits nuclei; fission involves emission",
                "Both are identical processes",
                "Fission only occurs in stars"
            ],
            correctAnswer: 0,
            explanation: "Fission is the splitting of heavy nuclei, often induced. Radioactive decay is spontaneous emission from unstable nuclei.",
            hint: "Think about what happens to the nucleus in each process.",
